During the second hack session, we:

-Grouped suicide hotline calls by veterans based on different parameters, allowing for easy visualization
-Found a data source which allowed us to view VA hospital performances (grouped by region).  We gathered information on the mental health evaluation section for each hospital.
In the future, we plan to find the exact percentiles of each score for the mental health parameters, create a weighted average, and create a map-based viz based on that.
